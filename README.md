## Why I made this?

I use [xCurrency](https://xcurrency.com/) on my phone, but I don't want to leave my mouse and keyboard when I am using the computer, so I made this app.

Copy a lot of designs from [xCurrency](https://xcurrency.com/).

For the best experience, I suggest you install this app by clicking the circled plus button on the right side of the Chrome/Edge address bar.

## Features

- Support 150+ currencies and cryptos
- Dark mode support
- Convert to multiple currencies at the same time
- English / ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡
- Update currency rates every 60 seconds
